Was the State Of The Map fantastic or what?!

With all the incredibly smart people lurking around, having sangria
and paella, talking about things I might never understand -- this must
the Mecca for map geeks. Or, at least it looked like it this year.

Anyway, here's a more structured way of reporting.

============
Organization
============

Everything starting from drinks and food and finishing with timing
and Internet worked as it should have. I think that's the highest
praise any even organizer can get. Of course, there were some
slight issues, such as lack of sockets in small room, but that
only somehow decreased twitter activity.

=====
Day 1
=====

Day 1 was marked by several big announcements:

* AOL's Map Quest will now use OpenStreetMap data. While they're still in beta,
  the plan is to use OSM for Germany and UK sites. The nice thing about MapQuest
  is that they sponsor development of Mapnik and Nominatim. [#mapquest]_

* Microsoft is going to add OpenStreetMap layer to Bing Maps. We'll have to
  wait until that happens, of course, but this is a good thing overall,
  considering the level of their cartography. I mean, just look at the
  "Sketchy" layer, you wont be able to resists its beauty.

* Curly Brackets announced their own vector rendering engine
  for iOS 4. Some might say that this is not as big as the previous
  two announcements, but I think this marks the start of moving away
  from server-side to client-side rendering for the sake of
  delivering better maps experience.

I must admit that I've missed half of the talks on Friday
because I was involved in Mapnik Birds of Feather discussion.
I'm not going to summarize it, because that was already
`done <http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/mapnik-devel/2010-July/001195.html>`_
beautifully by Richard Weait on Mapnik-devel list.

For those of you who missed SOTM 2010 I advise watching these talks (organizers say
that the videos will be available in the next two-three weeks):

* "Who are the mappers and why do they map in OpenStreetMap?" by Nama Raj Budhathoki, Muki Haklay and Zorica Nedovic-Budic

  In fact, this wasn't a real talk, just a summary of
  survey done in the past 3 or so months. The survey itself might
  be of low value, simply because of low numbers of people polled.
  But the analysis was pretty impressive and showed that most of
  the OSM mappers are in fact professional GIS specialists and/or
  cartographers.

* "Uncommon Operating Picture: Using OSM for Humanitarian Response" by John Crowley

  I missed this one, but I'd heard only good things about it.
  I think that the more OpenStreetMap is used for the greater
  good (that means, not only target well-developed countries)
  the better it is for community and the map data itself.

* "Map Kibera – Mapping one of Africa’s largest slums" by Mikel Maron

  Mikel showed everybody that we should move
  towards providing map data not only for the first-world countries.
  A very detailed and touching talk overall.
  Also, check out what has been done already at Map Kibera
  `official site <http://mapkibera.org/>`_\.

* Panel discussion "Cocktails on the Titanic?" by Steven Feldman.

  Big people from Google, Microsoft, MapQuest and CloudMade tried to
  explain what business model will make OSM-based start-ups take off
  successfully. I must admit that Steven Feldman has mastered
  provocative questions and used this skill very often during
  the panel. [#cocktails]_

At the end of the day, everybody was offered drinks and snacks on the terrace.
Most of the people didn't get enough food and alcohol (mostly alcohol) and so
the mappers continued to party in Girona bars.

=====
Day 2
=====

Saturday marked the start of non-business day, which means more interesting stuff
for geeks.

There were lots of good talks, but the best are (warning: subjective!):

* "OSM without Delay" by Matt Amos

  Matt is one of the core OSM server engineers and does a lot
  of interesting and useful things. He's currently working on
  `OWL <http://matt.dev.openstreetmap.org/owl_viewer/>`_
  which is basically a visualizer of recent (or
  not so recent) changes in different areas. Matt talked about
  how the OWL implemented, pointing out the cool features.
  If you missed the talk, you should check out Matt's
  `blog post <http://www.asklater.com/matt/wordpress/2010/07/osm-without-delay-sotm10-talk/>`_,
  where he provides detailed explanation of his talk.

* "Tag Central: a Schema for OSM" by David Earl

  This talk caused a lot of people wondering -- why doesn't
  David implement that instead of talking about it?
  The tagging schema has been discussed several hundreds times
  and in the end no one ever did implement it.
  This doesn't have to be part of the core functionality
  of OpenStreetMap anyway, so why not do it?
  Still, one of the best thought-out ideas about tagging
  schema I've ever seen.

* "What’s wrong with OSM?" panel discussion lead by Christopher Osborne

  We all know what's wrong and in order to fix we have to
  BAN POTLATCH. Well, not really. At least, nobody was talking
  about editors as being big problems of the OSM.
  I must say that I can't remember the exact problems
  discussed by the attendees, but the word "do-ocracy" coined
  by Mikel Maron is probably the best description
  of OpenStreetMap as a community I've ever heard.
  I'm eagerly waiting for the video of this one and I
  really hope that all the question from audience were
  recorded.

=====
Day 3
=====

Sunday aka "The Big Match Day" was full of nice talks, but the ones I really liked
were about cartography:

* "What I’d like to do with Mapnik" by Steve Chilton

  What I'd like to do with Steve Chilton is make him the king
  of the world and be with it. I'm serious, this talk was about
  so many beautiful things not possible (yet) in Mapnik. And
  all those things are implementable and would make any digital
  map rendered by this wonderful library even more beautiful.
  I advise this talk to anyone interested in cartography
  as a great place to learn about the beauty of maps.

* "What I learned making a real map on real paper for real people and real money" by David Earl

  This talk was pretty much in line with the talk from
  Steve Chilton, but paper maps of course need another type
  of cartography. So, this talk and the one about Mapnik
  IMHO were the best talks about maps as we know them -- images.
  Highly recommend this one!

* "MapOSMatic: City Maps for the Masses" by Thomas and Maxime Petazzoni

  Two Linux hackers, with basic knowledge of Python and
  another 4 persons they knew gathered together and in 5 days
  they had one of the best community project of OSM -- MapOSMatic.
  Not only this is useful (printed maps with indexes *are* useful)
  but it's also opensource. The talk itself wasn't that bright
  and informative but you should watch it anyway -- how else
  would you know about the internals and the history of
  MapOSMatic?

The tradition of SOTM is to close the conference with the auction, on which
the all those unused things -- such as two EEE PCs, several video recorders,
banners, maps, etc -- are sold. And again, just like in 2009, Henk Hoff
was very successful at selling things at very good prices.

======
People
======

I've met a lot of people I always wanted to see and also several people I've already
seen before but desperately need to talk more. Among these people are Dane
Springmeyer [#dane]_, Sean Gillies [#sean]_, Simon Willison [#simon]_,
Richard Weait [#richard]_ and many more.

things -- see you next year at State Of The Map 2011!
